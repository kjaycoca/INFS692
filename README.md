## Context
Irrespective of whether or not data and images are stored/analyzed in a centralized 
manner, variability in scanner models, acquisition protocols and reconstruction 
settings are unavoidable in the current clinical practice. Yet radiomics are notoriously 
sensitive to such protocol variations. Hence, there is a clear need for the harmonization 
of features in order to allow consistent findings in radiomics multicenter studies.

## Objective 
Irrespective of whether or not data and images are stored/analyzed in a centralized 
manner, variability in scanner models, acquisition protocols and reconstruction 
settings are unavoidable in the current clinical practice. Yet radiomics are notoriously 
sensitive to such protocol variations. Hence, there is a clear need for the harmonization 
of features in order to allow consistent findings in radiomics multicenter studies.

## Dataset
The dataset is the radiomics dataset. It contains 197 rows and 498 columns. The data was normalize before being used in the different model. ANd the failure.binary is 
the binary property to predict.

## Packages
Packages was load in every model.

## Models

### Bagging
### Support Vector Machine
### Gradient Boosting
